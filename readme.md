Appengine Objectify Scalatra G8 Template
========================================

> If I could think of a good name I'd use one!

This is a simple g8 template that you can use to build a simple AppEngine webapp that uses

   * [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org) for routing
   * [Twirl](https://github.com/spray/twirl) for templating
   * [Objectify](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine) for AppEngine ORM
   * [Google AppEngine](http://appengine.google.com) for hosting

If that matches your requirements, then this is for you.

Because it uses Objectify verison 4.0 in order to utilise the easiest scala integration, this is fully experimental until v4 is release.

Enjoy
